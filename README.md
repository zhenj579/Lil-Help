# Lil-Help
CUNY Hackathon Project 2021, best team work winner.

An Android app created with Android Studios for the 2021 CUNY Hackathon. The app allows you to journal things that you have done throughout the day and will notify you throughout the day to remind you of things that you should be proud of for achieving. This app was made to lift up the spirits of those who may be down during quarantine.
